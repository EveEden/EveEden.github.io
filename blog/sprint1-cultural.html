      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
    
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

    <div class="btext">
      <p>I once worked as an inspector and a person I was auditing smelt of alcohol.  I had the dilema of deciding if I report them.</p>
      <p>I thought about my mother, who values honesty, and considered the risk this person posed in this workplace.  I ended my audit and reported this person.  Some people got mad initially but they eventually calmed down and realised I was only doing my job and that I was consistent.  At first I felt bad but I felt the risk was worth it and remembered that I had not broken the rules so I shouldnt feel bad.</p>

    <h2 class="h3">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>My culture has helped shape my personal values by experiencing life within a whanau, and a greater community.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Australia, leaving Aotearoa as a baby and returning at 10 - I viewed things like Tangihanga with older eyes, and I remember thinking that even though I didnt completely understand what was happening, I did understand that it was important and that I was apart of something bigger.  That felt good.</p>
      <p>Ive always feel better working together with people, and have always made an effort to reach out.  I think that has come from being apart of groups of people - like in the kitchen or playing with my cousins.  A key personal value to me is Whakawhanaungatanga - or working together for the good of all.</p>

      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>

      <h3 class="h3">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>   
    </div>

    <div class="btext">
      <p>I worked for many years as an auditor which played to my strengths of confidence, objectivity and recall.  One of my limitations is believing im right and not being open minded, overloading myself with work and procrastinating.</p>
      <p>An ethical descision Ive had to make based on these is finding out a friend was cheating on his pregnant girlfriend and wondering if I should tell her.  Part of me wanted to stay out of it as I didnt want to be the bad guy.  I decided in the end that I would want to know so I told her.  Another person had also told her which made it a bit easier for me.  I think my confidence helped me as it was a hard choice but I believe the right one for that situation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>My culture has influenced the way I interact within my workplace, especially at lunchtime.  Im a big fan of eating, and learning languages, and have met some amazing people at work by sharing a meal.</p>
      <p>At one job, I was influential in organising a cultural night for the 40 different nationalities at our workplace.  It was an awesome event and people still ask me when im coming back to organise another one.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>My strenths in learning are that im confident in trying new things and im not afraid to seek answers.  My limitations would be trying to do too many things at once.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>My stubborness can be a strength, as its hard for me to admit failure and give up.  Obstacles for me would be distractions - I feel like I could overcome these with planning.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>I worked on a project which involved collaboration with another manager for an external sign off.  This manager found that the project was not viable and stated the external sign off could not happen.  I didnt agree and esculated it, and it got signed off, which was not well recieved.</p>
      <p>The strategy I used was to provide cite technical documentation and case studies.  It was a project I was passionate about, and I believed the positive outcomes would be worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Reflecting back, I would still fight for this project, but I would spend more time marketing it to managers to get them on board.  I would invest less in technical information, and more in appealing to the heart.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3">Part 2</h3>
    <h3 class="h3">Core Personal Values</h3>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>I would list my core personal values as honesty, kindness, hardwork and trustworthiness.  These are qualities I look for in my companions, as I believe you become who you surround yourself with.</p>
      <p>Looking back at how this has affected descisions in my life, I would say that remembering these things has helped bring my clarity when Ive struggled to make descisions.</p>
      <p>I still believe that my culture has heavily influenced my identity and my life.  Being apart of a whanau involves working in together with a large group of people who have a common cause.  This has personally helped me learn off others and to remember my place in a team.  The want to both share my culture and give back to my community has also influenced my descision to leave my job and study towards one that flexible with my whanau and community commitments.</p>
