  <h3>Journal</h3>
  <p>
  What suprised me the most about learning core is the fact that it was there! And also how much I enjoyed it.  It was really interesting to have dedicated time in a curriculum to analysing past experiences adn how they have impacted my descisions.  The neuroplasticity learning helped me to realise how I can improve my responses.

  <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
  Sometimes I need to slow down, which means I need to plan my time better.  I learnt that im much better when im on a schedule, which means choosing my commitments well creating a structure to make everything work.

  <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
  How much I enjoyed it.  The concepts are similar to the Te Whare Tapa Wha model which widens the scope of health to emotional well-being, spiritual and social well-being, instead of just physical health.  This is based on Maori philosophy that other factors influence our physical state.  Similarly, other factors influence how we learn and how sucessful we are in this path - we arent just "dumb" and it isnt just "too technical".  Core helped me to connect back to some of the drivers I have for taking this journey and identify how I can make it a sucessful one.
  </p>
  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
  Examining ethics was kind of confronting - I still dont know what my ethics are exactly, so I just thought about things that I admire in friends, like honesty and trustworthiness. 
  </p>

  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
  <p>
  Because this course is so intense, I believe this component has been encorporated to support students in this askpect of their journey to maximise success. 
  I think its a natural concept in Te Ao Maori, but quite radical for a business.
  </p>
  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  <p>
  No because its supporting the tech component, as long as your open to it.  The benefits are greater if you achieve success in both.
