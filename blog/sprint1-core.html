    <h1 class="font1">Identity and Values Exploration</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
    <p>I once worked in a factory as an inspector, which had made me kind of unpopular.  Im a confident person, and believed that I was doing my job for a reason, so it didnt usually bother me.  At a 5am check, I noticed the person I was calibrating smelt of heavily of alcohol.  My workplace was mostly maori, and would be considered high safety risk with zero drug and alcohol tolerance. </p>
    <p>I thought about my mother, who values honesty.  I stopped my check and reported my finding.  This resulted in a positive test and disciplinary action for the worker, and some angry co-workers for me.</p>
    <p>Eventually people calmed down and realised that I was only doing my job, and that I was consistent.  It was hard because I felt like I was selling out as a maori.</p>
    
    <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
            
    <p><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong></p>

    <p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
    <p>I worked for many years as an auditor which played to my strengths of confidence, objectivity and recall.  This meant I could make quick descisions by rating urgency, assessing risk and calling on technical procedures.
    <p>One of my limitations is believing im right and not being open minded.  I have made an effort to try to listen more and put myself in others shoes - it has been eye opening.</p>
    
    <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
    <p>My culture has influenced the way I interact within my workplace, especially at lunchtime.  Im a big fan of eating, and learning languages, and have met some amazing people at work by sharing a meal.</p>
    <p>At one job, I was influential in organising a cultural night for the 40 different nationalities at our workplace.  It was an awesome event and people still ask me when im coming back to organise another one.</p>

    <p>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
    <p>My strenths in learning are that im confident in trying new things and im not afraid to seek answers.  My limitations would be trying to do too many things at once.</p>

    <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
    <p>My stubborness can be a strength, as its hard for me to admit failure and give up.  Obstacles for me would be distractions - I feel like I could overcome these with planning.</p>

    <p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
    <p>I worked on a project which involved collaboration with another manager for an external sign off.  This manager found that the project was not viable and stated the external sign off could not happen.  I didnt agree and esculated it, and it got signed off, which was not well recieved.</p>
    <p>The strategy I used was to provide cite technical documentation and case studies.  It was a project I was passionate about, and I believed the positive outcomes would be worthwhile.</p>
    <p>Reflecting back, I would still fight for this project, but I would spend more time marketing it to managers to get them on board.  I would invest less in technical information, and more in appealing to the heart.</p>
