    <h3 class="h3">Use an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <div class="btext">
    <p>HTML and CSS are both used to create web pages, in a similar way that we would create a poster.</p>
    <p>HTML is like the blank paper with a pencil draft on it, it would be like a basic outline of all the elements you wanted to put on the page.</p>
    <p>CSS is like the paint and ink you use to create the background colours, the pictures and fonts styles and sizes.  Its what makes the page pretty.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="h3">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
    <div class="btext">
    <p>When you drive to work in the morning, there is a particular set of things you do, and responses from the car, that get you to your destination.</p>
    <p>A similar process is flow control and looping when executing code.</p>
    <p>Turning the key and putting the car into gear  is like giving an input to the engine to execute a pre-determined set of steps - If the key turns, flick a switch to the starter motor and start the engine.</p>
    <p>As with code, inputs can be variable - you can put the car into reverse, or first, or let it idle while you turn the heater.  The inputs that are chosen tell the electronics in the car to execute certain steps - IF the user puts the car to reverse, move the car, ELSE idle the car.  This would be an If/Else statement if our cars understood code.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="h3">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
    <div class="btext">
    <p>The Dom sounds like he would be a cool, fashionable gay friend who always refered to himself in the 3rd person and smelt good - but alas, its an interface that shows the HTML on a page as a tree of objects.</p>
    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and helps developers to work more communatively (im not sure if thats actually a word) by being able to see and manipulate the code for all web pages.  The changes arent permanent, unless you have higher access or spooky powers.</p>
    <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
    <p>An Array is a list of 'things', usually strings.  As you can imagine, it has a length - for example, a list of 3 things. You can access data from it by calling the list and asking for an item in a certain position, such as the second item.</p>
    <p>I like to think of an object like everyday objects - such as a basketball, which has properties like its colour, and the property has a value, in this case orange.  To call data from objects, we access the property, like colour, which returns the value.  In the case of the basketball, the value returned would be orange.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="h3">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
    <p class="btext">Functions are basically a set of instructions written in code.  The computer executes these when the function is called.  A function that is the property of an object is called a Method.  They are useful as you dont have to repeat instructions in your code.  The analogy on Watch and Code was that its like a recipe for a sandwich that you can sub in different fillings for.</p>
