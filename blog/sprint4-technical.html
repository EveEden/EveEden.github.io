  <div class="btext">
  <h3>A time I got blocked on a simple problem was...</h3>
  <p>
    During this course I was doing a test exercise and I didnt read the question properly.  I couldnt solve it so I kept trying to google answers and I got really frustrated.  I finally went back to the start and re-read it, then found it was really simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess the lesson was Less haste, More speed.
  </p>
  <h3>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way...</h3>
  <p>
    I wouldnt call my code elegant, but I have made an effort to tidy it as my understanding grows.  The only time I can think of solving a problem well was breaking it up and getting it to run basic commands, and building from there. 
  </p>
  <h3>Reflecctions</h3>
  <p>
    Looking at both of these situations, I would say the bigget lesson Ive learnt is to take the time to read the instructions thoroughly, and to keep things simple.  I keep trying to go fast and making things worse and more complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main problem solving technique I feel confident using is breaking the problem up. 
  </p>

  <h3>Comments on using the following techniques</h3>

  <h3>Psuedocode</h3>
  <p>
    When your learning to code, it seems silly to write obvious statements on small pieces of code.  The more I tie concepts together, the more I see the value in this.  Its also handy when looking at other peoples code.
  </p>
  <h3>Trying something</h3>
  <p>
    I feel confident to just try things as im quite a kinetic learner.  
  </p>
  <h3>Rubbger ducky method</h3>
  <p>
    I quite like talking to inanimate objects, so this is just an extension of something I already do.
  </p>
  <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
  <p>
    Not my strong point, but I have had some sucess with reading error messages.
  </p>
  <h3>Console.logging</h3>
  <p>
    I guess its bad that im not 100% sure what this is.  If it means returning a value to the console, then yes I do use it it testing functions.
  </p>
  <h3>Googling</h3>
  <p>
    My old friend - however like most things you need to be specific in your query or you can go down a rabbit hole of other things that you dont understand.
  </p>
  <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
  <p>
    Im bad at this - I dont know why.  Im confident talking to people, I just dont like asking for help.
  </p>
  <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
  <p>
    All good - everyone has been so great.
  </p>
  <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
  <p>
    The forced reflections actually really helps, and maybe why Ive started to do this in other area's of my life, like talking over my day with my daughter at bedtime and reflecting back on things Ive done and could have done better.
