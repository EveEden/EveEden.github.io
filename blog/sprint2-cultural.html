      <h3 class="h3">My Strengths and Limitations</h3>
      <p>I am a confident, active and persistent learner who loves working in a team (preferably to music ...).  I like to do alot of things at once - which can be a strength and a weakness.  I think my biggest strength has been my ability to apply concepts to many situations.</p>
      <p>I am limited by my want to do many things at once - at times I need to focus on completing actions more systematically.  I have family commitments and I try hard to train, mostly because it dissapates some of my hyperactivity.  These things make my time delegation more challenging.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">My plan forward</h3>
      <p>I plan to manage my workload by scheduling my time by week - this includes my family time, training schedule, studytime and work.  I will overview my workload, add it to my schedule with the timebox guidelines and assess it daily.</p>
      <p>My aim is to contribute to the slack community weekly, even if its just giving props to other peopls work, as well as checking in with    my co-ordinator atleast every 2 weeks.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Identifying and seeking help</h3>
      <p>I plan to identify the need for help by marking off progress on my schedule which I print to the fridge, next to my daughters chore sheet.  Part of her chores will be checking my progress.  She has been my biggest motivation to making these changes adn commiting to this course of study - I know she will be great motivation.</p>
      <p>I will seek help from the slack community, my co-ordinator and my whanau.</p>

      <h3 class"h3">Facillitation Expectations</h3>
      <p>I hope to be able to reach out to my facillitation team with questions.  My experience so far has been positive, and Ive found a huge level of understanding and support from this team, right from the first time I said "I want to take this course".</p>
