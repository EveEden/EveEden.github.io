  <h3>My Strengths and Limitations</h3>
  <p>
    I am a confident, active and persistent learner who loves working in a team (preferably to music ...).  I like to do alot of things at once - which can be a strength and a weakness.  I think my biggest strength has been my ability to apply concepts to many situations.
    I am limited by my want to do many things at once - at times I need to focus on completing actions more systematically.  I have family commitments and I try hard to train, mostly because it dissapates some of my hyperactivity.  These things make my time delegation more challenging.
  </p>

  <h3>My plan forward</h3>
  <p>
    I plan to manage my workload by scheduling my time by week - this includes my family time, training schedule, studytime and work.  I will overview my workload, add it to my schedule with the timebox guidelines and assess it daily.
    My aim is to contribute to the slack community weekly, even if its just giving props to other peopls work, as well as checking in with    my co-ordinator atleast every 2 weeks.
  </p>

  <h3>Identifying and seeking help</h3>
  <p>
    I plan to identify the need for help by marking off progress on my schedule which I print to the fridge, next to my daughters chore sheet.  Part of her chores will be checking my progress.  She has been my biggest motivation to making these changes adn commiting to this course of study - I know she will be great motivation.
    I will seek help from the slack community, my co-ordinator and my whanau.
  </p>

  <h3>Facillitation Expectations</h3>
  <p>
    I hope to be able to reach out to my facillitation team with questions.  My experience so far has been positive, and Ive found a huge level of understanding and support from this team, right from the first time I said "I want to take this course".</p> 
  
  <h3>Part 2</h3>
  <p>
    Im optimistic, confident and unafraid of a challenge.  These things can also be my limitations as I often bite off more than I can chew and lose motivatiton.  At times this has put me off setting ambitious goals and ive settled for a career that is easier to achive in the short term but not fulfilling.  Looking at these traits, I guess its all a matter of perception, and management.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe the key to my sucess is the same for gaining technical understanding.  To still set goals towards my dreams, but to break them down into smaller achieveable chunks.  I created a weekly goal list up to the end of bootcamp and have put this to my calendar with my whanau commitments.  I find weekly goals to be easier to achieve as my day often needs to be dynamic, much like my life.  My goal is to code for 5 hours a day for 5 days a week, whatever days they may fall.  I feel like this is achievable in my busy life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I still plan to mark off weekly progress to my schedule, ive put a picture of my kids beside it - they are all my why, and I will seek help from my co-ordinator and the slack community.
