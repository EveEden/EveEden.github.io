  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  
  <div class="btext">
  <p>
    When I first saw the headline for this primer it was late at night and I got flashes of an army of sad,pierced, androgynous teenagers in tight black jeans, with make up tears, offering data on Putins links to the Whitehouse.  But Emo Intell is so much more than that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I went deep on this one, and actually found some answers in my inner child.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emotional Intelligence is the ability for a person to identify emotions, and harness or manage them, either in themselves or others - quite powerful really.  Some psycholigists have poohoo'd it, but during my research it made me think about naughty kids - I know alot of naughty kids.  Ive found if you react to their behaviour your doing what they expect you to do - but if you recognise the way they are feeling, and look at why, you can often see a different side to them.  Its amazing to recognise an emotion in someone and help them to manage it - and especially in yourself.

  <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
  <p>
    IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, and is an assessment of Intelligence or understanding data and applying logic.  Emotional Intelligence differs from IQ in that it is a measure of the understanding and management of emotions.

  <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
  <p>
    EQ is important, because it deals with the reasons why we are doing what we are doing, or our motivations.  If we an understand those, we can use them to figure out what we want to do in the best possible way.
  </p>
  <p>The best example I can think of is a person who takes a career to please their parents.  If deep down, they dont want to do this, they wont be motivated or happy in this pursuit.  I know a person who sacrificed their happiness to study law, to please their parents.  Deep down they were unhappy and resentful, and eventually dropped out.  Had they recognised those feelings earlier, they could have saved themselves alot of time, and pain.
