    <h3 class="h3">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplaticity benefits people</h3>
        <p class="btext">

        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience or following injury.
        <br>
        It is the concept that our brains have the ability to change, or create new neural connecitons throughout their lifetime.  The stimulus for this can be both positive or negative, meaning that positive stimulus can create sucessful learning pathways, and negative stimulus can wire the brain to idea's such as paranoia.
        <br>
        A key concept in this is that Intelligence is not predetermined, so that anyone can learn anything.  With the right training, confidence and determination, you can basically do anything you put your mind to.

    <h3 class="h3">Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplaticity for your own benefit<h3>
        <p class="btext">
        The possibility that we can achieve anything we decide to do is amazing to me.  Its a concept I believe in and has been a key driver in helping me to make some of the biggest descisions in my life.
        At 25 I returned to University as an adult student studying a Bachelor of Engineering Biochemical.
        I initially wanted to give up after the first Chemistry class - I felt isolated and the concepts of physics, calculus, microbiology and computer science were very foriegn.  
        <br>
        Its could be easy to believe that intelligence is pre-determined when you are a minority in a class - I was female and maori, and the concept that people of colour and women are less intelligent has been common in history and still prevails today, even in New Zealand.
        <br>
        One of the key sucesses I had in passing these papers was finding a tutor who spoke to me in a way that my brain could understand.  
        <br>
        Developmental Psychopathology author Judy Willis states  "Whenever new material is presented in such a way that students see relationships, they generate greater brain cell activity (forming new neural connections) and achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval.‚Äù.  
        <br>
        My experience is that once I could see the information as concepts I already knew, it helped me to both understand and remember them.  I realised that if I could remember the lyrics of a song, I could remember elements of the periodic table and many elements of higher learning.
        <br>
        PS - I passed the first year of BE then dropped out.

    <h3 class="h3">What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplaticity</h3>
        <Div class="btext">
            <p>
            Because Neuroplasticity deals with the biological processes in the brain, it is sensible to say that physical health has benefits for learning.  Providing your body with fundamental vitamins and minerals and sleep is important.  
            <br>
            It is well known that stress can affect peoples ability to make good descisions, so finding ways to deal with stress is a good way to increase neuroplasticity.  An interesting concept is the Amygdala Hyjack or the fight or flight mechanism.  
            <br>

            <br>
            You can increase Neuroplasticity by challenging ourselves to learn new things - weather its physically by training for a marathon or mentally by understanding how engines work.  The act of starting on a path to learning increases our ability to do so.

            Happiness is important - this is one of my favourite TED talks about the power of what we think

    <h3 class="h3">What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
        <p class="btext">
        Growth Mindset is the concept that talents and abilities can be developed.
        </p>

        <p class="btext">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
        Blend with your learning plan and strategies

        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
